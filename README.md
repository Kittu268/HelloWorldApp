# AppDevInternship2025 - Weekly Progress (Weeks 1-5)

This document summarizes the progress made during the first five weeks of the Android App Development Internship, focusing on the development of an applicationフロー from user login to a content download feature.

## Week 1: Project Setup & Login Screen UI
*   Successfully set up the Android Studio development environment.
*   Initialized the Android project and became familiar with its structure.
*   Learned the fundamentals of Kotlin for Android development.
*   Designed and implemented the basic UI layout for the application's **Login Screen** (e.g., using XML with input fields for username/password and a login button).

## Week 2: Login Functionality & Basic Navigation
*   Implemented the core logic for user authentication on the Login Screen.
    *   (e.g., Handled button clicks, retrieved input, basic validation).
*   Worked on navigating the user to a main part of the application upon successful login.
*   Began planning the user flow towards a "download" feature.

## Week 3: Developing Core App Screens & UI for Download Area
*   Built out the primary screens or activities that users would access after logging in.
*   Designed the UI for the section of the app where users would initiate a **Download Screen** or download action.
    *   (e.g., A list of items to download, a dedicated download page).
*   Implemented navigation to this download-related screen or section.

## Week 4: Implementing Download Feature Logic
*   Focused on the backend logic for the download functionality.
    *   (e.g., Handling button clicks to start a download, managing file URLs or sources).
*   Considered and possibly implemented necessary permissions (e.g., for storage access if saving files).
*   Worked on providing user feedback for the download process (e.g., progress indicators, completion messages).
*   Initial testing of the download screen and its functionality.

## Week 5: Git Management, Code Refinement & Review
*   Deepened understanding of Git version control, focusing on branching strategies (transitioning from `master` to `main`).
*   Successfully performed merging operations to consolidate development history into the `main` branch.
*   Organized the GitHub repository by standardizing on `main` and removing the `master` branch.
*   Reviewed and refined the code for the login-to-download feature flow.
*   Ensured project history was clearly documented and pushed to GitHub.
